### Objective

The Enterprise Network Lab project aimed to create a simulated real-world enterprise environment for hands-on experience in networking and systems administration. The primary focus was on building a lab network that included a Windows Server 2019 acting as the domain controller, DHCP server, and DNS server, along with Windows and Linux clients. Key tasks involved creating users, connecting client hosts, and managing group policies to enhance network security.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in managing domain services such as DNS, DHCP, and Active Directory.
- Ability to create and manage user accounts within a domain.
- Hands-on experience in connecting Windows and Linux clients to the domain.
- Knowledge of implementing and enforcing security policies through Group Policy.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2019 for domain controller, DHCP, and DNS services.
- Windows and Linux clients for simulating diverse end-user systems.
- Active Directory for user account management and authentication.
